## Workflow Structure: Calendar → Timesheet → Google Sheets

This system is designed to track and calculate employee working hours. It includes three main workflows:

---

### 1. CalendarToTimesheet

Employees log their tasks and meetings in Google Calendar. This workflow automatically calculates the duration of each activity and stores it in the Timesheet calendar.

---

### 2. TimesheetToGoogleSheets

All working-hour data from the Timesheet calendar is collected and transferred to Google Sheets, where it becomes the basis for payroll calculations.
